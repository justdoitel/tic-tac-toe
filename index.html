        <h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>
        <p>
            Basic Rules: Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking a 3x3 grid.
            The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the round.
        </p>
        <h2>Specific rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You'll play five rounds</li>
            <li>Player 1 is always X while Player 2 is always O</li>
            <li>Player 1 would start the first round. However, for the following rounds, the winner of the previous round would begin the game.</li>
            <li>If a round ends in a draw, the next round (if there is one) would start with the player who didn't start last time. </li>  
            <li>At the end of the fifth round, whoever has the most wins wins the whole game. </li>
            <li>If the two players are tied, then the game would end in a tie.</li>
        </ul>
